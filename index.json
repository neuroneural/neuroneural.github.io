Although an active field for the last 60 years, the current demand as well as trust in machine learning exploded as increasingly more data become available and the problems needed to be addressed become literally impossible to program directly. In this advanced course we will cover essential algorithms, concepts, and principles of machine learning. Along with the traditional exposition we will learn how these principles are currently being revisited thanks to the recent discoveries in the field.\n1.

A common and plausible assumption is that higher measurement frequencies are the only way to gain more informative data about the underlying dynamical causal structure. This assumption is a strong driver for designing new, faster instruments, but such instruments might not be feasible or even possible. In this paper, we show that this assumption is incorrect: there are situations in which we can gain additional information about the causal structure by measuring more than our current instruments. We present an algorithm that uses graphs at multiple measurement timescales to infer underlying causal structure, and show that inclusion of structures at slower timescales can nonetheless reduce the size of the equivalence class of possible causal structures. We provide simulation data about the probability of cases in which deliberate undersampling yields a gain, as well as the size of this gain.\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/causal-learning-through-deliberate-undersampling/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Causal Learning through Deliberate Undersampling"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Alex Fedorov, Eloy Geenjaar, Lei Wu, Tristan Sylvain, Thomas P DeRamus, Margaux Luck, Maria Misiura, R Devon Hjelm, Sergey M Plis, Vince D Calhoun\nPublication date : 2022/9/7\nJournal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.02876\nDescription\nRecent neuroimaging studies that focus on predicting brain disorders via modern machine learning approaches commonly include a single modality and rely on supervised over-parameterized models.However, a single modality provides only a limited view of the highly complex brain. Critically, supervised models in clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse labels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes, which leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less useful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale coordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive biases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised fusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced computational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships between local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease phenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain regions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training. The proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with improved classification performance for both modalities.

MRI data usually requires extensive preprocessing before it is ready for modeling, even via deep learning, in part due to its high dimensionality and heterogeneity. A growing array of MRI preprocessing pipelines have been developed each with its own strengths and limitations. Recent studies have shown that pipeline-related variation may lead to different scientific findings, even when using the identical data. Meanwhile, the machine learning community has emphasized the importance of shifting from model-centric to data-centric approaches given that data quality plays an essential role in deep learning applications. Motivated by this idea, we first evaluate how preprocessing pipeline selection can impact the downstream performance of a supervised learning model. We next propose two pipeline-invariant representation learning methodologies, MPSL and PXL, to improve consistency in classification performance and to capture similar neural network representations between pipeline pairs. Using 2000 human subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, we demonstrate that both models present unique advantages, in particular that MPSL can be used to improve out-of-sample generalization to new pipelines, while PXL can be used to improve predictive performance consistency and representational similarity within a closed pipeline set. These results suggest that our proposed models can be applied to overcome pipeline-related biases and to improve reproducibility in neuroimaging …\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/pipeline-invariant-representation-learning-for-neuroimaging/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Pipeline-Invariant Representation Learning for Neuroimaging"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Md Rahman, Usman Mahmood, Noah Lewis, Harshvardhan Gazula, Alex Fedorov, Zening Fu, Vince D Calhoun, Sergey M Plis\nPublication date : 2022/7/21\nJournal : Scientific reports\nVolume : 12\nIssue : 1\nPages : 1-15\nPublisher : Nature Publishing Group\nDescription\nBrain dynamics are highly complex and yet hold the key to understanding brain function and dysfunction. The dynamics captured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are noisy, high-dimensional, and not readily interpretable. The typical approach of reducing this data to low-dimensional features and focusing on the most predictive features comes with strong assumptions and can miss essential aspects of the underlying dynamics. In contrast, introspection of discriminatively trained deep learning models may uncover disorder-relevant elements of the signal at the level of individual time points and spatial locations. Yet, the difficulty of reliable training on high-dimensional low sample size datasets and the unclear relevance of the resulting predictive markers prevent the widespread use of deep learning in functional neuroimaging.

Most studies have focused on identifying groups differences and have typically ignored the heterogeneous patterns within groups.

We then visualize the original sFNC in a 2D grid according to the samples in the VAE latent space. We observe a high correspondence between the generated and the original sFNC.

However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approach for analyzing dFNC models the system through a fixed sequence of connectivity states. SWC assumes connectivity patterns span throughout the brain, but they are relatively spatially constrained and temporally short‐lived in practice. Thus, SWC is neither designed to capture transient dynamic changes nor heterogeneity across subjects/time. We propose a state‐space time series summarization framework called “statelets” to address these shortcomings. It models functional connectivity dynamics at fine‐grained timescales, adapting time series motifs to changes in connectivity strength, and constructs a concise yet informative representation of the original data that conveys easily …\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/statelets-capturing-recurrent-transient-variations-in-dynamic-functional-network-connectivity/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Statelets: Capturing recurrent transient variations in dynamic functional network connectivity"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Mohammadsajad Abavisani, David Danks, Sergey Plis\nPublication date : 2022/5/18\nJournal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.09235\nDescription\nGraphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Although this problem has been recently recognized, practitioners have limited resources to respond to it, and so must continue using models that they know are likely misleading. Existing methods either (a) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; or (b) can handle only very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; or (c) apply to only pairs of variables, though with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge; or (d) return impractically too many solutions. This paper addresses all four challenges. We combine constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions. The resulting system provides a practical approach that scales to significantly larger sets (\u0026gt;100) of random variables, does not require precise knowledge of the timescale difference, supports edge misidentification and parametric connection strengths, and can provide the optimum choice among many possible solutions. The cumulative impact of these improvements is gain of multiple orders of magnitude in speed and informativeness.\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/constraint-based-causal-structure-learning-from-undersampled-graphs/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Constraint-Based Causal Structure Learning from Undersampled Graphs"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Debbrata K Saha, Vince D Calhoun, Yuhui Du, Zening Fu, Soo Min Kwon, Anand D Sarwate, Sandeep R Panta, Sergey M Plis\nPublication date : 2022/5/1\nJournal : Human Brain Mapping\nVolume : 43\nIssue : 7\nPages : 2289-2310\nPublisher : John Wiley \u0026amp; Sons, Inc.\nDescription\nPrivacy concerns for rare disease data, institutional or IRB policies, access to local computational or storage resources or download capabilities are among the reasons that may preclude analyses that pool data to a single site.

Thus, satellite surfaces can charge thousands of volts with respect to each other whereas entire satellites can charge tens of thousands of volts negative of their surrounding space plasma. The ensuing electric fields can cause local discharges (arcs), endangering the normal operation of the satellite. Remote detection of spacecraft arcing is important for the satellite operators in order to properly respond to anomalies caused by spacecraft charging due to the space weather conditions. However, analysis of satellite data is laborious due to the amount of data generated. In this work, we explored the application of machine learning for analysis of GEO satellite arcing behavior using the radio frequency observations by the Arecibo 305 m telescope.\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/application-of-machine-learning-to-investigation-of-arcing-on-geosynchronous-satellites/","tags":["Paper","Publications","2022"],"title":"Tracking whole-brain connectivity dynamics in the resting state"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Md Mahfuzur Rahman, Noah Lewis, Sergey Plis\nPublication date : 2014/3/1\nConference : ICLR 2022 Workshop on PAIR {\\textasciicircum\nDescription\nInterpretability methods for deep neural networks mainly focus on modifying the rules of automatic differentiation or perturbing the input and observing the score drop to determine the most relevant features.

The applications of such methods are vast and diverse, but most of the current work relies on the assumption of a static graph. This assumption does not hold for many highly dynamic systems, where the underlying connectivity structure is non-stationary and is mostly unobserved. Using a static model in these situations may result in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, modeling changes in graph structure with time can provide information about the system whose applications go beyond classification. Most work of this type does not learn effective connectivity and focuses on cross-correlation between nodes to generate undirected graphs. An undirected graph is unable to capture direction of an interaction which is vital in many fields, including neuroscience. To bridge this gap, we developed dynamic effective connectivity estimation via neural network training (DECENNT), a novel model to learn an interpretable directed and dynamic graph induced by the downstream classification/prediction task. DECENNT outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five different tasks and infers interpretable task-specific dynamic graphs. The dynamic graphs inferred from functional neuroimaging data align well with the existing literature and provide additional information. Additionally, the temporal attention module of DECENNT identifies time-intervals crucial for predictive downstream task from multivariate time series data.\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/deep-dynamic-effective-connectivity-estimation-from-multivariate-time-series/","tags":["Paper","Publications","2022"],"title":"Deep Dynamic Effective Connectivity Estimation from Multivariate Time Series"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Harshvardhan Gazula, Kelly Rootes-Murdy, Bharath Holla, Sunitha Basodi, Zuo Zhang, Eric Verner, Ross Kelly, Pratima Murthy, Amit Chakrabarti, Debasish Basu, Subodh Bhagyalakshmi Nanjayya, Rajkumar Lenin Singh, Roshan Lourembam Singh, Kartik Kalyanram, Kamakshi Kartik, Kumaran Kalyanaraman, Krishnaveni Ghattu, Rebecca Kuriyan, Sunita Simon Kurpad, Gareth J Barker, Rose Dawn Bharath, Sylvane Desrivieres, Meera Purushottam, Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, Eesha Sharma, Matthew Hickman, Mireille Toledano, Nilakshi Vaidya, Tobias Banaschewski, Arun LW Bokde, Herta Flor, Antoine Grigis, Hugh Garavan, Penny Gowland, Andreas Heinz, Rüdiger Brühl, Jean-Luc Martinot, Marie-Laure Paillère Martinot, Eric Artiges, Frauke Nees, Tomáš Paus, Luise Poustka, Juliane H Fröhner, Lauren Robinson, Michael N Smolka, Henrik Walter, Jeanne Winterer, Robert Whelan, Jessica A Turner, Anand D Sarwate, Sergey M Plis, Vivek Benegal, Gunter Schumann, Vince D Calhoun, IMAGEN Consortium\nPublication date : 2022/1/1\nJournal : bioRxiv\nPublisher : Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\nDescription\nWith the growth of decentralized/federated analysis approaches in neuroimaging, the opportunities to study brain disorders using data from multiple sites has grown multi-fold.

Results showed hypoconnectivity across the majority of networks including sensory, default mode, and subcortical domains, more for alcohol than smoking, and decreased low frequency power.

However, the focus has primarily been on global graphic metrics with little attention to the information contained in paths connecting brain regions. Details of disruption of these paths may be highly informative for understanding disease mechanisms. To detect the absence or addition of multistep paths in the patient group, we provide an algorithm estimating edges that contribute to these paths with reference to the control group. We next examine where pairs of nodes were connected through paths in both groups by using a covariance decomposition method. We apply our method to study resting-state fMRI data in schizophrenia versus controls. Results show several disconnectors in schizophrenia within and between functional domains, particularly within the default mode and cognitive control networks …\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/path-analysis-a-method-to-estimate-altered-pathways-in-time-varying-graphs-of-neuroimaging-data/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Path analysis: A method to estimate altered pathways in time-varying graphs of neuroimaging data"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Samin Yeasar Arnob, Riyasat Ohib, Sergey Plis, Doina Precup\nPublication date : 2021/12/31\nJournal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.15579\nDescription\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration, substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters. State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However, they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity. Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/single-shot-pruning-for-offline-reinforcement-learning/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Single-shot pruning for offline reinforcement learning"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Elena A Allen, Eswar Damaraju, Sergey M Plis, Erik B Erhardt, Tom Eichele, Vince D Calhoun\nPublication date : 2021/11/22\nSource : Neuroinformatics\nPages : 1-14\nPublisher : Springer US\nDescription\nThe field of neuroimaging has embraced sharing data to collaboratively advance our understanding of the brain. However, data sharing, especially across sites with large amounts of protected health information (PHI), can be cumbersome and time intensive. Recently, there has been a greater push towards collaborative frameworks that enable large-scale federated analysis of neuroimaging data without the data having to leave its original location. However, there still remains a need for a standardized federated approach that not only allows for data sharing adhering to the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) data principles, but also streamlines analyses and communication while maintaining subject privacy. In this paper, we review a non-exhaustive list of neuroimaging analytic tools and frameworks currently in use. We then provide an update on our federated neuroimaging analysis …\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/federated-analysis-of-neuroimaging-data-a-review-of-the-field/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Federated analysis of neuroimaging data: A review of the field"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Elena A Allen, Eswar Damaraju, Sergey M Plis, Erik B Erhardt, Tom Eichele, Vince D Calhoun\nPublication date : 2014/3/1\nJournal : Cerebral cortex\nVolume : 24\nIssue : 3\nPages : 663-676\nPublisher : Oxford University Press\nDescription\nSpontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity (FC) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording. In this work, we describe an approach to assess whole-brain FC dynamics based on spatial independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering of windowed correlation matrices. The method is applied to resting-state data from a large sample (n = 405) of young adults. Our analysis of FC variability highlights particularly flexible connections between regions in lateral parietal …\nView article\n","permalink":"http://splis.gsucreate.org/posts/tracking-whole-brain-connectivity-dynamics-in-the-resting-state/","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Tracking whole-brain connectivity dynamics in the resting state"}]
